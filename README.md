## Game in JavaScript
<br/>

**Spot-it!** is a great game to help you train the speed of your eyes, your hands and the ability to memorize images. 

The concept is simple: each of the 28 playerâ€™s cards (on the right of screen) have eight symbols, and there is exactly one matching symbol between them and computerâ€™s card. Your goal is find out quickly the match between two cards. Click on playerâ€™s card your symbol that you choose. If itâ€™s the right symbol, you get one point, if not you havenâ€™t a point. In the two cases that you can find out the right symbol or not, once you click the cards will be next automatically.
You must also complete your 28 cards within a limited time (depending on the level you choose) otherwise the game will be over. If you can finish it in time (but must have a point) then you are the winner.

This game is realized by **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.  The **canvas** is used to draw the main part of the game - the cards.

Letâ€™s play and have fun !

From Julie with love
